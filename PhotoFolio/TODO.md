# TODO: Improve Gallery Responsiveness for Mobile Portrait in index.html

- [x] Update all 17 gallery item div classes from "col-xl-3 col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-6" to "col-6 col-lg-4 col-xl-3" to ensure 2 columns on all screens including xs (<576px), improving layout on devices like Galaxy S21 Ultra in portrait.
- [x] Verify the updated HTML structure.
- [ ] Test the layout across breakpoints (xs to xl) using browser to confirm 2 columns on mobile portrait (e.g., 360px width), no overflow, proper spacing, and functional hover links/gallery effects.
